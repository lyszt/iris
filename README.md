Iris (Ίρις) is the golden-winged herald of the gods. Born of the sky and the sea, she creates the rainbow—a bridge that connects the heavens to the earth. Unlike other messengers who are bound by terrain, Iris moves with the speed of wind, carrying commands instantly across the boundaries of the world.
